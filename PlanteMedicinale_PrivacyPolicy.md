This is a simple Android app developed by Lupirion Apps in flutter. it is only for refference of different medicinal plants. They are all hard coded and does not even need access to the internet.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,

Lupirion Apps.
